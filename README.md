## MODELLING (Efficientnet B0)

Image classification via fine-tuning with Efficient Net
Efficient Net, first introduced in Tan and Le, 2019 is among the most efficient models (i.e. requiring least FLOPS for inference) that reaches State-of-the-Art accuracy on both ImageNet and common image classification transfer learning tasks.
